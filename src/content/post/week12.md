## Follow-up

Here are a few links to follow-up from the today's discussions:

- Rohit asked about the Harvard admissions lawsuit. There are two
expert reports from the case: [Peter Arcidiacono's (for "Students for
Fair Admissions")](/docs/Arcidiacono-Expert-Report.pdf) and [David
Card's (for Harvard)](/docs/harvard-report.pdf). They are both long
reads, and with some parts redacted, mostly about Harvard's "Dean's
List" for taking care of high donors.  Unfortunately (or prehaps
responsibly), the raw data for the analysis is not publicly available,
but there is a lot of information in the reports.

- Here is the article I mentioned: Ta-Nehisi Coates. [_The Case for
  Reparations_](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/06/the-case-for-reparations/361631/),
  The Atlantic, June 2014. (Its not about AI fairness at all, but
  provides a lot of historical context for where we are now as a
  society, and something I would encourage everyone to read over
  winter break.

## Next (Final) meeting

Next week is our final seminar meeting. Everyone should be prepared to
give a short talk (no more than 3 minutes long) on your paper
project. Unlike previous ones, I would encourage you to prepare slides
for this, but you should not use more than 4 slides (not counting one
for the title).

There is no reading preparation assignment, but if you have ideas for
what to do at the final meeting, or food suggestions, please send them to me.
