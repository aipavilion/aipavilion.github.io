Since not everyone has joined the slack yet, I'm sending this out by
email, but please make sure to join
[https://secprivml.slack.com](https://secprivml.slack.com) soon. I
will use that for future communications.

I have grouped the 18 full participants in the class into three teams of six:

**Team Bus:**

Anant Kharkar  
Ashley Gao  
Atallah Hezbor  
Joshua Holtzman  
Mainuddin Ahmad Jonas  
Weilin Xu  

**Team Gibbon:**

Aditi Narvekar  
Austin Chen  
Ethan Lowman  
Guy "Jack" Verrier  
Jialei Fu  
Jin Ding  

**Team Panda:**

Bargav Jayaraman  
Christopher Geier  
Faysal Hossain Shezan  
Nathaniel Grevatt  
Nishant Jha  
Tanmoy Sen  

The teams will probably adjust a bit over the next week as some people
who registered for the class didn't submit a survey, and others may be
joining the class late, etc., but otherwise we will plan to keep with
these teams through spring break and possible re-arrange things after
that.  You can, of course, rename your team and develop your own
adversarial (but tasteful) team icon.

Each week, one team will be responsible for leading the class, one
team for blogging (writing a summary of the class), and one team for
food. Everyone in the class is expected to do the preparation for each
meeting, which will usually involve reading a few papers (but may
involve other activities, at the design of the leading team).  See
[https://secml.github.io/teams/](https://secml.github.io/teams/) for
the description of team responsibilities.  For the first week, Team
Bus will be the leading team, Team Gibbon will be the feeding team,
and Team Panda will be the blogging team.  I have created a slack
channel for each team, and you should have an invitation to join
it. The immediate tasks for each team are:

- Team Bus: decide on a leader who will be responsible for coordinating your team for this week, come up with some ideas what you would like to do for Friday's meeting, make sure there are some people who can come to my office hours on Monday (2:30pm) - if not enough people can come then, arrange an alternative time with me, and plan an exciting and worthwhile seminar for Friday.

- Team Gibbon: you are the feeding team for this week, so should select 2-3 people to take care of this. One of you should pick up a credit card from me on Thursday to pay for the food. You will be leading the seminar on 2 Feb, so should determine a leader for this, and once Team Bus posts the topic and paper for this week (which should happen on Monday), should start planning your topic. We should meet briefly after Friday's seminar, to discuss your plans, and then a longer meeting the following Monday.

- Team Panda: you are the blogging team for this week, so should get familiar with https://secml.github.io/blogging/. You will be leading the seminar or 9 Feb, so should start thinking of topics you would like to lead. You should identify leaders for blogging, feeding, and leading to be ready for the next 3 weeks.

Cheers,
