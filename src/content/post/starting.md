Our first seminar meeting will be Friday, January 26 (not this Friday, which would normally be the first class day, since I will be getting back from California too late to meet this week). Meetings will be Fridays in Rice 032, 9:30am-noon.

Since we're missing the normal first meeting, I want to do as much of the organizational stuff this week to be able to have a substantive first meeting next week. This means we will group students into teams, have a team assigned to lead the first class, and announced topic and readings by next Tuesday (Jan 23).

To enable this, everyone interested in participating in the class in any way should:

   1. Submit this form by Wednesday (Jan 24): [https://goo.gl/forms/FqSmUNHYBPbaKsg72](https://goo.gl/forms/FqSmUNHYBPbaKsg72)

   2. Read the [course syllabus](/syllabus/), and follow the directions there to join the seminar slack group.

I will work out the teams based on the form submissions, and set up the schedule for leading classes/blogging. I will have office hours on Monday (Jan 22) at 2:30pm. People from the first presenting team will be expect to meet with me then (not necessarily everyone but at least some of the team), and anyone with questions about the seminar is also welcome to come by. (If this time works for the class, we'll keep this as my regular office hours time for the semester.)

Sorry for missing the first class, but I think we'll be able to manage most of what we would have done the first day electronically, and be able to have an effective first meeting on Jan 26.
