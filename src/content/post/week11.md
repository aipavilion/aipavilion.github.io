## Reading/Viewing Assignment

Next week, we'll talk about algorithmic fairness.

There are lots of very interesting writings on this, but I want to
keep the required reading over Thanksgiving break to a minimum.

For the required reading, you can select one of these two options:

1. Watch Christopher Moore's talk, [_Data, Algorithms, Justice, and Fairness_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg2jtEY6qms&t=5s) (Ulam Lecture at Santa Fe Institute, Oct 2018). (You can skip the excellent but long introduction by [starting at 12:19](https://youtu.be/Sg2jtEY6qms?t=737).

2. Read [_Machine Bias_](https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing), ProPublica, 23 May 2016, and [Northpointe's response](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2998391-ProPublica-Commentary-Final-070616.html) (with commentary from ProPublica).

Please post something in the [course
subreddit](https://redd.it/9ynlx3) to spark discussion on this
topic. It could be a link to a news article on algorithmic fairness
with a brief comment on it, or a question or comment about the reading
(or talk).
