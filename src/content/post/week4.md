### Paper Ideas

The idea for your first paper is due **Sunday, 30 September**. From
the syllabus, the first paper can "focus on one aspect of how
artificial intelligence has already impacted society, describing the
impact of technological advances on a social, political, economic, or
psychological aspect of human existence." It is not required that your
paper idea is on this topic though &mdash; anything that is relevant
to the seminar theme (broadly interpreted), interesting, and with a
scope suitable for a 4-5 week effort is reasonable. 

You should post your paper idea on the [class
subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/aipavilion/). Submit a new text
post (or a link post that links to a PDF) that has a title `Paper:
_your title` and contains:

- One sentence: what is your paper about
- 1-2 paragraphs that motivate your topic
- A short list of things you plan to do (e.g., readings) to develop your idea

The best ideas for will make an argument for a non-obvious and
controversial claim and include data to support that argument.

**Elevator Pitches.** In class next week, youâ€™ll give an elevator
pitch for your idea to the class for feedback. This should be about 90
seconds long &mdash; enough to give a clear idea of your idea and why
it is worth doing, but getting to the point concisely.

### Assignment

Before the next class (Monday, 1 October), you should read:

- Yuval Noah Harari, _Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind_, Chapters
  18, 19 and Afterword.

- <a href="/docs/hallpike-review.pdf">Hallpike's review of Sapiens</a>

- Tim Urban ("Wait but why"), <a
  href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-2.html"><em>The
  AI Revolution: The Road to Superintelligence</em></a> (Part
  2). (Posted in 2015) 

**Sapiens Response.** Now that you've finished _Sapiens_, post a
  comment that mentions the most surprising or interesting thing you
  learned from reading it and explains why. [[Discussion Link]](https://redd.it/9iuzz2)

**Hallpike Response.** Select one of Hallpike's criticisms of
  _Sapiens_ (this could be a specific quote from his review, or a
  paraphrase of a main point), and make a case opposing
  it. Alternatively, if you find all of Hallpike's criticisms valid
  and convincing, respond to one of the cases posted with a
  counter-argument. [[Discussion Link]](https://redd.it/9iv2b5)

(There's no response question for the Superintelligence reading, but
feel free to post any thoughts you want on this. I'm not sure if we'll
get to discussing this next meeting, but it, and readings from
Bostrom's book, will be the main focus of the next few weeks.)
