[Loebner Prize (Turing Test)](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html)  
[Let's chat with Mitsuku!](https://www.pandorabots.com/mitsuku/)  

The transcripts you read were from [_Can machines think? A report on Turing test experiments at the Royal Society_](/docs/turingtestexperiments.pdf), Kevin Warwick and Huma Shah, Journal of Experimental & Theoretical Artificial Intelligence, 2016. 

### Upcoming: First Paper

The idea for your first paper is due Sunday, 30 September. From the
syllabus, the first paper can "focus on one aspect of how artificial
intelligence has already impacted society, describing the impact of
technological advances on a social, political, economic, or
psychological aspect of human existence." It is not required that your
paper idea is on this topic though &mdash; anything that is relevant
to the seminar theme (broadly interpreted), interesting, and with a
scope suitable for a 4-5 week effort is reasonable. We'll talk more
about this next week, but you should start thinking of ideas for your
paper now.

### Assignment

Before the next class (Monday, 24 September), you should read:

- Yuval Noah Harari, _Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind_, Chapter
  14-17 (if you want to read further, we'll complete the book the
  following week).

- Neil DeGrasse Tyson, <a href="/docs/tyson.pdf"><em>Science's Endless Golden Age</em></a>.

- Tim Urban ("Wait but why"), <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html"><em>The AI Revolution: The Road to Superintelligence</em> (Part I). (Posted in 2015)

- (optional) John Maynard Keynes, <a href="/docs/keynes.pdf"><em>Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren</em></a>, 1930.

**Read carefully, different from previous weeks:**
Everyone should (1) post at least one "fact check" (about any claim of
your choice in any of the readings), (2) post a response to one of the
readings (I've provided some promts for the _Sapiens_ chapters below,
but you can respond to any of the readings by posing and answering
your own question, and (3) post a (thoughtful and respectful) comment
on someone else's fact check or response. (If you are the first one to
do (1) and (2), you do not need to do (3).)

### Response prompts for _Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind_, Chapters 14-17

(Chapter 14) Question 1: Harari writes, 

> "All modern attempts to stabilise the sociopolitical order have had no choice but to rely on either of two unscientific methods:

> a. Take a scientific theory, and in opposition to common scientific
practices, declare that it is a final and absolute truth. This was the
method used by Nazis (who claimed that their racial policies were the
corollaries of biological facts) and Communists (who claimed that Marx
and Lenin had divined absolute economic truths that could never be
refuted).

> b. Leave science out of it and live in accordance with a
non-scientific absolute truth. This has been the strategy of liberal
humanism, which is built on a dogmatic belief in the unique worth and
rights of human beings – a doctrine which has embarrassingly little in
common with the scientific study of Homo sapiens." 

This seems like a pretty bleak choice. Is there no other option? (or
is one of these, less unpalatable than it seems in Harari's writing?)

(Chapter 14) Question 2: Harari writes about Bacon's argument in
[_Novum Organum
Scientiarum_](https://www.earlymoderntexts.com/assets/pdfs/bacon1620.pdf)
that "knowledge is power". In founding the University, Jefferson
wrote, 

> "[T]his last establishment [a state university] will probably
be within a mile of Charlottesville, and four from Monticello, if the
system should be adopted at all by our legislature who meet within a
week from this time. my hopes however are kept in check by the
ordinary character of our state legislatures, the members of which do
not generally possess information enough to percieve the important
truths, that knowlege is power, that knowlege is safety, and that
knowlege is happiness."

(when the [University uses this
quote](https://news.virginia.edu/content/university-virginia-publicly-launches-3-billion-campaign)
they tend to leave out the context that it was part of a dig against
the state legislators). 

How much of an influence on Jefferson was Bacon? (This isn't really a
response question, but something you might be interested in looking
into.)
 
(Chapter 16) Question 3: Harari quotes Adam Smith, "In the new
capitalist creed, the first and most sacred commandment is: ‘The
profits of production must be reinvested in increasing production.’"
In Smith's time, businesses produced physical goods, and producing
more of them required investment in capital. Today, most businesses
mostly produce virtual goods, that can be produced in unlimited
quantities without any production cost. Has this changed the
capitalist creed?

(Chapter 16) Question 4: Harari writes, "Much like the Agricultural
Revolution, so too the growth of the modern economy might turn out to
be a colossal fraud.  The human species and the global economy may
well keep growing, but many more individuals may live in hunger and
want." He offers two answers to this (there's no alternative, and we
just need more patience), neither of which seems very satisfying. Is
there a better answer?

(Chapter 17) Question 5: 
>  "The history of ethics is a sad tale of wonderful ideals that nobody
can live up to. Most Christians did not imitate Christ, most Buddhists
failed to follow Buddha, and most Confucians would have caused
Confucius a temper tantrum.  In contrast, most people today
successfully live up to the capitalist-consumerist ideal. The new
ethic promises paradise on condition that the rich remain greedy and
spend their time making more money, and that the masses give free rein
to their cravings and passions – and buy more and more. This is the
first religion in history whose followers actually do what they are
asked to do. How, though, do we know that we’ll really get paradise in
return? We’ve seen it on television."
