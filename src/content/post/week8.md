## Schedule Updates

**Office Hours this week:** I will not be able to hold my Thursday morning office hours this week, but will be available later in the day Thursday. I should be around most of the afternoon, so feel free to drop by, or email me to arrange a time.

**Paper 1** is due **Thursday, 1 November** at **4:59pm**. (This is a
  strict deadline since I need to print the papers before leaving on a
  trip.). Please remember to follow the [directions posted last
  week](/week7) about what to include in your email.

**Short talks:** You should prepare a five minute presentation about your paper topic, to present in class next Monday (5 November).

**Happy Halloween!** Beware of trick-xor-treaters  who are impersonating valid trickers.
