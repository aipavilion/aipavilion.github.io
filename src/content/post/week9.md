## Announcements

Anton Korinek in Economics is offering a course in the Spring on _Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Work...and of Humanity_, with lots of themes related to this seminar. A tentative syllabus is [posted here](https://sites.google.com/a/korinek.com/home/download/AI_Syllabus.pdf).

Next week, [Allison Pugh](https://allisonpugh.weebly.com/), Professor
of Sociology at UVA, will visit us. You should read the paper
distributed in class today, _Of Seeing and Being Seen: What Humans Do
for Each Other_.

I will finish reading your papers by my office hours Thursday
(9-10:30am). Please stop by if you can to pick up your paper, or find
me some other time (feel free to stop by anytime you see my office
open).

## Reading Assignment

Read Allison Pugh's paper distributed in class, _Of Seeing and Being
Seen: What Humans Do for Each Other_ (if you lost the paper copy,
email me for a PDF), and post your responses
[here](https://redd.it/9ul2bz) by Sunday, 11 November.

You should either post your own question or comment on the paper,
respond to someone else's comment, or respond to one of these
questions:

- The paper considers three connective labor relationships: doctor-patient, teacher-student, and minister-congregant. Identify another connective labor relationship and discuss how the ideas in the paper might (or might not) apply to it.
 
- Why are measurement strategies for connective work so ineffective? Are there strategies that could work?

- "The downside of freedom from shame, it seems, is freedom from caring at all." Is there a way to have caring without shame?
