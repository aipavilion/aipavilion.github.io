## Reading Assignment

Next week, we'll talk about security and malicious uses of AI. 

There are two readings. If you did the discussion post for last week,
you should select **either one of these two readings**; if not, you
should read both of them (you'll get a confirmation email from me if
you are in this group).

- Daniel Geer. [_A Rubicon_](https://www.hoover.org/sites/default/files/research/docs/geer_webreadypdfupdated2.pdf). Hoover Institution, Aegis Paper No 1801. February 2018.  [[Discussion](https://redd.it/9wr59x)]

- Miles Brundage, et al. [_The Malicious Use of Artificial
Intelligence: Forecasting, Prevention, and
Mitigation_](/docs/malicious.pdf). February 2018.  (This looks long,
but is low-density format. Read at least through the end of Section
3. It is not necessary to read their Interventions and the later
sections, although you should think about what recommendations you
would make.) [[Discussion](https://redd.it/9wr5iw)]

In the form, **post and idea for a discussion point** based on the
reading. There are no specific prompts for this, it can be anything
that strikes you as interesting to discuss from the reading.
