Paper updates are due next week Tuesday, November 20. For everyone,
you should send an email with subject line `[AI Pavillion] Paper Update: <your title>`. What is expected in the update depends on
whether you are continuing with your first paper topic for the final
paper, or you are starting a new topic.

For students starting new topics for the final paper, you should:

- In the email body, answer (1) brief statement of your topic, (2) purpose of your paper, and (3) your plans for what to do through the final deadline (this can include specific sources you will be looking into, and what you are planning to do for the final paper). These can be refinements of the topic idea you've already sent me, and some have in discussion now.

- Attach a PDF that includes at least the introduction to your paper (this should be 1-2 pages that setup the purpose of your paper).

For students continuing with the topic for your first paper:

- In the email body, explain (1) how your topic and purpose have evolved, or if they haven't changed, (2) what you have done since the last paper submission to develop your work, and (3) your plans for what to do through the final deadline (this can include specific sources you will be looking into, and what you are planning to do for the final paper). 

- Attach a PDF with the updated paper, and (4) in the email explain clearly which section(s) you want me to provide feedback on. This should include the Introduction which is usually the most important section of any paper, since if it doesn't set up a compelling paper no one will want to read the rest. If you have other sections that you want feedback on now, mention that in the email. 

Hope this is clear and makes sense for everyone. The goal of this is to ensure that everyone is on track for an interesting and high quality paper by the end of the semester. If you are at a stage where something else would be more useful (either in terms of the Nov 20 deadline or what you are sending), let me know and we can consider alternatives.
