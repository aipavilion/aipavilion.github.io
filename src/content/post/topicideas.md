To help with topics for future classes, I've created a
[Topics](/topics) page with some possible ideas and links to papers.
This is not meant to be exhaustive by any stretch; any topics loosely
connected to machine learning security and privacy is within scope,
and there are lots of great papers on these topics not included on
this page.  But, hopefully it will be a useful starting point for
teams looking for ideas for topics for future classes.
