### Description

Artificial intelligence has made remarkable advances in the past
decade, leading to machines that can out-perform humans on many of the
tasks that once defined what it means to be human: understanding
language, recognizing images, playing games, and even creating
art. According to many prognosticators, within just a few decades we
may reach a world where the traditional purposes of human existence,
and the work the preponderance of humans do today, will no longer
exist. This seminar will explore the validity of such predictions, and
consider what the future of humanity is in a world that may not need
us. We will explore these issues from a variety of perspectives,
spanning economics, politics, philosophy, computer science, and
anthropology. We will include both historical and fictional readings
to understand how humanity has adapted to past dramatic shifts,
technical readings to understand the present and future of artificial
intelligence, philosophical and political readings to understand how
society might adapt to increasingly intelligence machines, and various
other media including computer simulations, music, and movies.

### Coming soon...

The rest of the syllabus will be posted here around August.
