<h3 id="description">Description</h3>

<p>Artificial intelligence has made remarkable advances in the past
decade, leading to machines that can out-perform humans on many of the
tasks that once defined what it means to be human: understanding
language, recognizing images, playing games, and even creating
art. According to many prognosticators, within just a few decades we
may reach a world where the traditional purposes of human existence,
and the work the preponderance of humans do today, will no longer
exist. This seminar will explore the validity of such predictions, and
consider what the future of humanity is in a world that may not need
us. We will explore these issues from a variety of perspectives,
spanning economics, politics, philosophy, computer science, and
anthropology. We will include both historical and fictional readings
to understand how humanity has adapted to past dramatic shifts,
technical readings to understand the present and future of artificial
intelligence, philosophical and political readings to understand how
society might adapt to increasingly intelligent and powerful machines,
and various other media including computer simulations, music, and
movies.</p>

<h3 id="expected-background">Expected Background</h3>

<p>This is a <a href="http://college.as.virginia.edu/PAVS">Pavilion Seminar</a>,
open to students in all majors and targeted to third and fourth-year
students in the College. Enrollment is by instructor permission, and
strictly limited to 15 students.</p>

<p>Students are not required to have any particular background in
computing or artificial intelligence, but it is hoped that all
students will bring some interesting experience and background to the
seminar.</p>

<h3 id="assignments">Assignments</h3>

<p>Students in the seminar will be expected to complete a variety of
different types of assignments during the semester, including:</p>

<p><strong>Readings and Reactions:</strong> Most weeks we will have reading (and
sometimes viewing) assignments that will typically be some chapters
from a book and a few short articles. Short weekly responses to
readings and questions posted about the readings.  These essays will
be posted on the class forum, and available to all students in the
class for further discussion and comments.</p>

<p><strong>Papers:</strong> There will be two major papers in the seminar. For both of
the papers, students will develop an idea for the paper and discuss it
with the class, submit a preliminary draft to the instructor for
feedback, and would be expected to revise the final paper in response
to comments and discussion. For the first paper, students will focus
on one aspect of how artificial intelligence has already impacted
society, describing the impact of technological advances on a social,
political, economic, or psychological aspect of human existence. For
the second paper, students will speculate on the future, grounding
their arguments in technical understanding of the expected
capabilities of artificial intelligence, and considering how humanity
may adapt to a future with intelligent machines. Students are
encouraged to develop creative ideas for alternative topics for the
papers, as well as alternate communications tools (such as a scripted
video or podcast instead of a paper), and to discuss and gain approval
for proposed alternatives with the course instructor.</p>

<p>The deliverables for the paper assignments are (deadlines are by 11:59pm on the date given):</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Sunday, 30 September</b>: Idea for First Paper Due</li>
<li><b>Wednesday, 17 October</b>: First Paper Draft Due</li>
<li><b>Tuesday, 30 October</b>: First Paper Final Due</li>
<li><b>Sunday, 11 November</b>: Proposal for Final Paper Due</li>
<li><b>Tuesday, 20 November</b>: Draft of Final Paper Due</li>
<li><b>Monday, 10 December</b>: Final Paper Due</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="readings">Readings</h3>

<p>The main books we will read for the first part of the class will be:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Yuval Noah Harari, <em>Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind</em>. February
2015 (first published in Hebrew in 2011)
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sapiens-Humankind-Yuval-Noah-Harari/dp/0062316117/">[Amazon]</a>
<a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/sapiens-yuval-noah-harari/1118611502#/">[Barnes &amp;
Noble]</a></p></li>

<li><p>Nick Bostrom, <em>Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies</em>. 2014.
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Superintelligence-Dangers-Strategies-Nick-Bostrom/dp/0198739834">[Amazon]</a>
<a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/superintelligence-nick-bostrom/1117941299">[Barnes &amp; Noble]</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>The focus books for the second half of the class will be selected
based on students&rsquo; interests and the discussions we have in class, but
the most likely books include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Cathy Oâ€™Neil. <em>Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens
Democracy</em>. 2016.</p></li>

<li><p>Martin Ford. <em>Rise of the Robots: Technology and the Threat of a Jobless Future</em>. 2015.</p></li>

<li><p>Yuval Noah Harari. <em>Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow</em>. 2017.</p></li>

<li><p>Jerry Kaplan, <em>Humans Need Not Apply: A Guide to Wealth and Work in the Age of Artificial Intelligence</em>. 2015.</p></li>

<li><p>Garry Kasparov, <em>Deep Thinking: Where Machine Intelligence Ends and
Human Creativity Begins</em>. 2017.</p></li>

<li><p>Max Tegmark. <em>Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence</em>. 2017.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to the books, there will be readings from articles and
other materials. The weekly reading assignments will be posted on the
course site.</p>

<h3 id="honor">Honor</h3>

<p>We believe strongly in the value of a <em>community of trust</em>, and expect
all of the students in this class to contribute to strenghtening and
enhancing that community.</p>

<p>As a student at the University of Virginia, you are trusted to be
honorable and expected to behave in ways that merit that trust. We
take advantage of this trust to provide a better learning environment
for everyone.  The course will be better for everyone if everyone can
assume everyone else is trustworthy, and we start from the assumption
that all students at the university deserve to be trusted.</p>

<p>For most assignments in this course, you will be encouraged to discuss
ideas and work with others to develop your ideas, but expected to do
your writing on your own. You will always be expected to credit any
collaborators and properly cite any resources you use. The honor
expectations for each assignment should be clearly stated and make it
unambiguous what is and is not permitted. If it is ever unclear what
is considered acceptable on an assignment, please check with me.</p>

<h3 id="expectations-and-accommodations">Expectations and Accommodations</h3>

<p>It is my goal to create a learning experience that is as engaging,
worthwhile, and accessible as possible. We hope the topics we discuss
in this class will be ones where many students feel passionately and
have strong views they want to share. Some of the readings will
contradict your deeply held beliefs and challenge your assumptions.
It is important that everyone is respectful and that discussions focus
on ideas and evidence, and that everyone has an opportunity to share
their thoughts without interruption.</p>

<p>Since the class only meets once a week, and is in a seminar style, it
is essential that everyone attend every class, prepares well and
contributes outside of class, and is fully engaged during the seminar
time. That said, I understand that personal circumstances arise that
may make this difficult or impossible for some students some weeks. If
you are encountering issues that make it difficult to participate
fully in the seminar, please let me know as soon as possible, and we
will work something out.</p>

<p>If you anticipate any issues related to the format, materials, or
requirements of this course, please meet with me outside of class so
we can explore potential options. Students with disabilities may also
wish to work with the Student Disability Access Center to discuss a
range of options to removing barriers in this course, including
official accommodations. Please visit their website for information on
this process and to apply for services online:
<a href="sdac.studenthealth.virginia.edu">sdac.studenthealth.virginia.edu</a>. If
you have already been approved for accommodations through SDAC, please
send me your accommodation letter and meet with me so we can develop
an implementation plan together.</p>

<h3 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h3>

<p>My hope is students will focus on learning and producing something of
value.</p>

<p>Students will be evaluated primarily based on:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Overall contribution to the seminar. This includes contributions in
class and one the course forum, as well as any extraordinary
contributions to making the seminar worthwhile.</p></li>

<li><p>Quality of the major writing assignments. Papers will be evaluated
for their creativity, novelty, persuasiveness, and clarity. For both
of the major papers, students will have opportunities to submit
early versions of the paper for feedback, and will be expected to
improve the writing based on that feedback. The grades will be based
on the final papers, after revisions based on feedback from the
proposal and first draft.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I don&rsquo;t provide a generic percentage breakdown for each of the
components, since excellent performance on any one of them (along with
acceptable effort on the others) will be enough to justify an A in the
course.  For a typical students, I would expect the grade is
determined by 50% for the final paper, 25% for the first paper, and
25% for class contributions.  But a student who does an outstanding
job on the first paper, or who consistently makes outstanding
contributions to the course, will have heavier weighting for those
components.</p>
